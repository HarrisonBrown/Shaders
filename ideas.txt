## Rolling Cube

A rolling cube, shockwaves emerge in a square around the base of the cube after each 'roll'.
Rolls in direction of mouse - Probably can't do smoothly
Inspired by the cover art for 'Something I Always Do' by Canti

## Hillside twilight

Recreate the view from the chilterns after sunset, when the towns' lights are flickering and the sky is that rich dark blue
